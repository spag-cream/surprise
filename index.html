                <p>hiiii my pretty most beautiful woman in the world, today isn't just about candles or gifts. Today is about celebrating you, the woman who changed my life in a ways i never expected, the woman who stayed when it would've been easier to walk away.</p>
                
                <p>I still remeber the first time we met. I didn't know then that you would become this important to me. I didn't know that one day, your voice would calm me, your presence would feel like home, and your smile ughhh ka gwapa HAHAHAHA would be the thing i'd protect the most. Do you still remember when we bought ice cream from our first meet and you said you weren't really into vanilla HAHAHAH kai imo tiyan</p>

                <p>I was once like vanilla, plain and searching for peace. I kept saying something was my first time, when in truth it had adlready happedned before. one moment turned into many, and the repitition slowly darkened me. I carried that cycle without realizing how much it was changing me. Until you came into my life. you didn't add another layer of darkness, you stopped it. you became the cherry on top, the one who ended the cycle and changed everything. you are the part that made it different. the part i will hold onto and cherish forever.</p>

                <p>we shared so many memories sa. the moments we kissed first day palang, the one na HAHAHAHAH i got lock sa cr bok chicken uwawa HAHAHAHAH, our first photobooth. tong we went sa bukid, seeing you get frusrtated padong saka HAHAHAHAHAHA. but it still made me happy. seeing you there, feeling the breeze, surrounded by nature, while our song aura if you dont know aura piano ang gi play rn hehehe. that song feels like us. it talks about a love thats feels calm, grounding, and real. the kind that makes the world slow down and feel tighter. in that moment, it was exactly what i wanted, peace, happiness, just us. i want to feel that with you every day, forever. those memories are carved into my heart. they remind me of what love is supposed to feel like when it's genuine.</p>
                
                <p>I always pray that you are safe wherever you are even tho permi ka priso sa balay HAHAHAHAH. i pray that i can make you comfortable, make you happy, and give you the kind of love that lets you rest. I thank god for giving me a woman who is patient, strong, genuine, and full of love. I thank god for the peace i feel now. I thank god for the change happening within me and i thank god every day that there is a woman who truly loves me. that woman is you.</p>

                <p>you changed me love, you made me want to become better, not just talk about it, you showede me that love is not about attention or validation, but about consistency, respect, and choosing one person every single day because of you, i am becoming a man i can finally be proud of.</p>

                <p>I will love you every day, every month and every year that i am given. i want to celebrate our monthsaries and anniversaries not just a s dates on a calenday but as reminders that we choose each other again and again. I want to stay by your side through every season of life through the easy days and the hard ones and if god allows it, I dream of a future where we grow old together, build a life filled with peace and laughter, and one day stand in front of everyone and promise forever. I want to live this life with you, love you for as long as i breathe, and keep choosing you until the very end.</p>
